Step-by-Step Data Collection Protocol (Follow This Exactly)

1. Fix Your Camera Setup (Very Important)

    Same height
    Same tilt
    Same orientation
    Same lens settings
    Include Motion Blur 

Never change this.


2. Capture Frames While Walking (Natural Data)

Capture rate:

    1 frame every 1–2 seconds
    This avoids near-duplicate frames

Why this matters:

    Consecutive frames are highly correlated
    Too many similar images = overfitting


3. Collect Data in ALL Target Environments

Corridor

    Empty corridor
    Narrow passage
    Side pillars
    Partial obstruction

Seminar hall

    Clear aisle
    Chairs on both sides
    Chairs partially blocking
    Cluttered entry


4. Labeling Rule (This Is Crucial)

    For each frame, ask:

    “Can a person safely walk straight forward for ~2 steps?”

    YES → CLEAR_PATH
    NO → OBSTACLE

    This keeps labeling consistent across environments.



OBSTACLE: 868
Clear: 425
